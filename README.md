## File Description:
* Data [folder]  
  The folder contains model training data and various files for fingerprint generation networks. Among them, 1_Cocrystal_data.csv is the cocrystal data used by the model, and 2_Cocrystal_molecule.csv contains all the molecular nodes.
    
* External Validation Set [folder]  
  The folder contains two external validation set data files, along with their sources and related evaluation files. In external_validation_set1.csv, both molecules are part of the network; in external_validation_set2.csv, one molecule is from within the network, and the other is an NCE (New Chemical Entity).
  
* Results [folder]  
  The results of the model predictions are all saved in the Results folder.
    
* Software [folder]  
  The software is a package that can be directly downloaded and saved for local use. Double-clicking on GUI.exe will open the software Cocry-pred.
    
* evaluation.py
  evaluation.py is the tuning code used for selecting the best fingerprints and adjusting hyperparameters.
  
* Predict.ipynb  
  Predict.ipynb is the prediction code, and all results will be saved in the Results folder.
  
* Software-GUI.ipynb  
  Software-GUI.ipynb is the GUI interface we have developed, which users can directly invoke or make certain modifications to.
  
* User Guide.docx  
  User Guide.docx is the specific software usage manual.
  
## Creation of the GUI Usage Environment:
